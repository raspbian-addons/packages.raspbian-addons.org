search_packages.pl:
- all searches:
  - Display "$pkg ($section) shortdesc from stable (or if not available, testing, unstable, ...)"
    tersely on one line each, with "#foo" links to what's currently displayed.
  - The 'extended' can maybe also have full descriptions then (maybe add did
	to _small.db?)
  - Unify exact & subword -- reduce naming confusion with 'exact' meaning
	either "exactly the same" or "full word"
  - When doing substring searches, hilight with html backgroup color (css of
	course) the search term
- exact package searches
- substring searches on packages:
  - don't allow whitespace in it, warn when people use common wildcards like
	*, ?, ^, $ (not possible)
  - When overflow, iterate the first couple of packages that *start* with the
	substring, if any? Maybe list those first, and only then real substring
	search?
  - In db, add "abc: too many matches" to postfixes when there's a "abcd: 90
	matches" and abce: 90 matches"

- fulltext search:
  - Max 100 results
  - Better exact=1 performance by indexing per word?
  - drop case-sensitive from options, descriptions.txt all lowercase and without
	punctuation, such that instead of =~ //, indexof can be used
  - in results, show full descriptions, so one sees what's being matched?

- backend:
  - Ensure that in _small.db, newest version for each suite is first,
	show_package relies on that. So foreach suite, 'newest entry', and only
	then, all the other entries

Static pages:
- try to make it faster

General:
- Try to break everything with empty/short searches
- Check for case sensitive consistency
- Fix assumption that archive doesn't show up in any url, consistency-fy
  dealing with archives of a different set than (us, non-us, security)
- grep -ri fixme
- searchon=all -> searchon=descriptions?
- quicksearch box: copy parameters of current search (exact,suite,arch,etc),
  or rather, always use defaults? Both have their pro&cons... former is more
  obscure, but otoh, for typo fixing more appropriate.
  Maybe best of both worlds is 'modify search' below results, where you can
  generalize/specificy arch, etc etc?
- In Search.pm, make sure read_entry_small only scans a bit, and not all --
  once you have #max_nr_of_suites, you know you won't find the queried suite
  anymore, so search further is futile. Maybe the backend could even add a
  marker, ignored by read_entry_all, but understood by read_entry_small, that
  indicates end of $res2 and start of $res3


Missing pieces from old code:
 - txt version of all packages list
 - DDTP support (but without a working DDTP I will not invest any time
   in that)
 - search_packages compatibility (we should at least ensure we don't break
   sarge's reportbug)
