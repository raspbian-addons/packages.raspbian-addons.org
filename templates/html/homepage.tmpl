<p>Adapted for hardy release. Removed the obsolete powerpc data for hardy. I'm currently evaluation if and how I should
include information about <tt>ports.ubuntu.com</tt> packages here. Since <tt>archive.ubuntu.com</tt> is currently unusable
I use <tt>nl.archive.ubuntu.com</tt> as source for the data until the situation normalizes again.</p>
</dd>
<dt>2008-02-21</dt>
<dd>
<p>The downtime today was caused by some yet undiagnosed kernel troubles after
a faulty hard disk was exchanged. Sorry for any inconvenience.
</dd>
<dt>2008-02-19</dt>
<dd>
<p>Switched packages.ubuntu.com to the newer codebase that also runs
on packages.debian.org. The two most important changes for users
are that most pages are now generated dynamically (which makes
for faster updates and more flexibility) and that the search
functions should be much faster now.
<p>Still waiting for a volunteer that optimizes the used stylesheets,
I myself have not much talent in this area...
</dd>
<dt>2007-10-21</dt>
<dd>
Add hardy.
</dd>
<dt>2007-10-18</dt>
<dd>
Change default release to gutsy.
</dd>
<dt>2007-07-28</dt>
<dd>
Drop old releases since they also got dropped from archive.ubuntu.com.
</dd>
<dt>2007-04-29</dt>
<dd>
Feisty is released. Pages updated accordingly.
</dd>
<dt>2006-11-20</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The hard drive of the server was replaced today after it began to act
up. Most stuff should be up and running again. I accidentally deleted the
info about new packages though, so that will be not reliable for the next
few days.
<li>Added edgy-backports to the homepage and the search forms
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>2006-10-29</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Add feisty. The changes for the edgy release were already done some days ago.
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>2006-10-18</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The "Bug reports" links now correctly point to Launchpad for all packages.
Thanks to all the people that reported this error to me.
<li>I added an <code>robots.txt</code> to ban some people trying to
mirror the site by means of <code>wget -r</code>. If forever reason
you need to mirror the site please contact me by mail so we can do
this by other means that won't stress the server as much.
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>2006-06-12</dt>
<dd>
Finally make dapper the default for searches and add edgy. Sorry for the delay.
</dd>
<dt>2006-01-17</dt>
<dd>
I hope everyone had a good start into the new year. Some small status
updates:
<ul>
<li>While looking at the log statistics I noticed that apparently
<code>packages.ubuntulinux.org</code> also points to my server
without me knowing. I fixed the apache configuration so that it now
knows about that and handles it correctly.</li>
<li>Linking to a CSS file on the official Ubuntu homepage
was a bad idea and the page had some glitches when it disappeared.
Most of the issues should be fixed by now.</li>
<li>Sorry for any performance issues with the site. My little server
is not always able to handle the many hits of this site (close to
2,000,000 per month). I guess I will have to search for another
hosting solution in the near future.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>2005-10-13</dt>
<dd>
Changed all defaults to point to breezy
</dd>
<dt>2005-09-28</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The contents files are updated again, so I removed any warnings
and added the appropriate links back</li>
<li>The "Check for bug reports" links now point to Launchpad for
universe/multiverse packages. Suggested by
<tt>j -at- bootlab -dot- org</tt>.
<li>Finally, I migrated to the "new" layout. Comments and Patches
about the remaining quirks welcome.
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>2005-09-25</dt>
<dd>
I've merged the new changelog to HTML conversion code from the Debian
branch. I still have no idea how to handle the requests to link Ubuntu
bugs to the Ubuntu BTS and Debian bugs to the Debian BTS. Suggestions
welcome.
</dd>
<dt>2005-08-30</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I've added a warning to this site about the outdated Contents
files in the Ubuntu archive which make the contents search completely
useless for anything after warty. I've actually no idea whom to ask
about this since I don't seem to be able to find out on the Ubuntu
web site who is ftp-master in Ubuntu?</li>
<li>You can now also browse the packages from
<a href="hoary-backports/">hoary-backports</a></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>2005-06-10</dt>
<dd>
I have begun to work on integrating the current Ubuntu web design with
my pages. There are still some issues to work out but as a teaser I
already converted the front page. Feel free to mail me with comments
on how I could use the new layout better.
</dd>
<dt>2005-04-14</dt>
<dd>
hoary is released and now this fact is also beginning to show on this
page. Please report all errors you find with the new breezy pages.
</dd>
<dt>2005-04-06</dt>
<dd>
The transition should be completed by now and I've installed some
rewrite rules so that old URLs should also point to the new location.
The changelog extraction script is still running so there are still
some (more) broken links. Please report all other problems you might
encounter.
</dd>
<dt>2005-04-05</dt>
<dd>
From tomorrow on this site will be available at <a
href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/">packages.ubuntu.com</a>.
The necessary setup is done on both my side and on the side of the
ubuntu people but I will use the occasion for some configuration
clean-up and a full rebuild. Stay tuned <tt>;)</tt>
</dd>
<dt>2005-04-02</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>On request of the MOTUs I've added links to the build logs for
hoary packages.</li>
<li>Also, the Portuguese LoCoTeam (hmm, Ubuntu teams have
all very l33t names ;) asked me
how to translate the pages. Here my answer:

<blockquote style="font-family: monospace">
<p>At http://cvs.infodrom.org/packages.debian.org/po/?cvsroot=debian.de
you can find some .pot files. Please translate them and send them back
to me (You may want to take a look at the translations available at
http://cvs.debian.org/webwml/portuguese/po/?cvsroot=webwml
especially for files like langs.pot). This will ensure that at least
the constant strings on all the pages are translated (Some of the
strings in these file are only needed on packages.debian.org)</p>

<p>The translations of package descriptions I took from the DDTP (Debian
Descriptions Translation Project) which seems to be rather inactive
lately. Unless this is fully revived or another similar project is
created there is little I can do on this front.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Thanks to all people that provided me with positive feedback about
these pages.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>2005-03-02</dt>
<dd>I talked briefly with Daniel Silverstone of Canonical at
<a href="http://www.fosdem.org/">FOSDEM</a>. He said that Ubuntu
will get his own Packages page, but <q>It will be a while</q>.</dd>
<dt>2005-01-24</dt>
<dd>In the last two days there were several reboots of the server
needed (kernel upgrades, activation and testing of a new rescue
system). Sorry for any inconviences this caused.</dd>
<dt>2005-01-11</dt>
<dd>There are changelogs and copyright files available now. I also
added links to the Ubuntu bugzilla, but I'm not sure yet that they
work completly. Feedback welcome. (Changelogs and copyright files
may be missing for some packages since I can only mirror the
i386 and powerpc debs due to space constraints)</dd>
