INSTALL
=======

This should give you an idea about the basic steps. It is probably very rough
around the edges, feel free to ask for clarifications so we can improve it.

This guide assumes you are working on a Debian lenny system. If that is not the
case, you might have to adjust some of the steps.

1) Install git (package git-core). You will get a much more pleasant user
   experience if you use a version from backports.debian.org or a self-compiled
   one instead of lenny's version.
2) Download the code from git://git.debian.org/git/webwml/packages.git
   (Something like `git clone git://git.debian.org/git/webwml/packages.git')
3) Install the needed dependencies. A list can be found in debian/control and
   used with dpkg-checkbuilddeps to check for missing deps.
4) Install apache2 (apache2-mpm-worker), mod_perl (libapache2-mod-perl2) and
   Apache2::Reload (libapache2-reload-perl)
5) Adjust the configuration to your needs. You should at least edit the
   following files before starting to test (don't touch %TOPDIR% and %SITE%, as
   you will specify it later):
   - ./config.sh.sed.in
     (especially : admin_email, and localdir and/or ftproot if you have local
     caches)
   - ./templates/config.tmpl
     (especially : packages_homepage)
   - ./templates/config/*
     (especially if you have your own repositories)
   - ./conf/apache.conf.sed.in
   - ./conf/trusted.gpg (that can be a link to
     /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg)
6) run `./bin/setup-site <topdir> <site>'
   (e.g. `./bin/setup-site /srv/packages.debian.org packages.debian.org')
7) create a cache directory for the compiled templates, it needs to be writable
   by apache (i.e. on default lenny by www-data). Default location is
   <topdir>/cache. So
   chown www-data <topdir>/cache
   chmod 2770 <topdir>/cache
8) Include ./conf/apache.conf in apache's configuration, e.g. by symlinking it
   from /etc/apache2/sites-available/ and then using a2ensite
9) Enable at least the following apache modules: `a2enmod expires rewrite'
10) Run ./bin/daily
   (this takes a while, especially the first time, as it downloads a lot of
   data, [at the time of this writing approx. 900 MB], creates databases,
   pre-builds heavy pages, etc.)
11) Set up ./bin/daily to be run regulary. In ./conf/crontab you can find an
   example crontab to do this. Actually preferable is to trigger the script by
   archive updates, but you will know best if and how to implement that in your
   setup.
