INSTALL
=======

This should give you an idea about the basic steps. It is probably very rough
around the edges, feel free to ask for clarifications so we can improve it.

This guide assumes you are working on a Debian etch system. If that is not the
case, you might have to adjust some of the steps.

1) Install git (package git-core). You will get a much more pleasant user
   experience if you use a version from backports.org or a self-compiled one
   instead of etch's version.
2) Download the code from git://source.djpig.de/git/packages.git
   (Something like `git clone git://source.djpig.de/git/packages.git')
3) Install the needed dependencies. A list can be found in cron.d/050checkinst.
   One dependency can't be fulfilled directly from etch and is therefor not listed
   there: the Search::Xapian perl module. You can either compile that yourself against
   libxapian from etch, backport all of xapian and libsearch-xapian-perl from
   lenny, or install the 0.9.9-1 deb from snapshots.debian.net.
4) Install apache2 (apache2-mpm-worker) and mod_perl (libapache2-mod-perl2)
5) Adjust the configuration to your needs. You should at least edit the following
   files before starting to test:
   - ./config.sh.sed.in
   - ./templates/config.tmpl
   - ./templates/config/*
   - ./conf/apache.conf.sed.in
6) run `./bin/setup-site <topdir> <site>'
   (e.g. `./bin/setup-site /org/packages.debian.org packages.debian.org')
7) create a cache directory for the compiled templates, it needs to be writable by
   apache (i.e. on default etch by www-data). Default location is
   <topdir>/cache
7) Include ./conf/apache.conf in apache's configuration, e.g. by symlinking it from
   /etc/apache2/sites-available/ and then using a2ensite
8) Run ./bin/daily
